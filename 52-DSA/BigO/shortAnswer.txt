1. True or false: n^2 + n is O(n^2).
    True, n^2 is the highest power.

2. True or false: n^2 * n is O(n^3).
    True, n^2 is bounded under n^3.

3. True or false: n^2 + n is O(n).
    False, n^2 > n.

4. What’s the time complexity of the .indexOf array method?
    O(n), is goes through array length n.

5. What’s the time complexity of the .includes array method?
    O(n), is goes through array length n.

6. What’s the time complexity of the .forEach array method?
    O(n), is goes through array length n.

7. What’s the time complexity of the .sort array method?
    O(nlog(n)), since fastest sorting algorithm is nlog(n)

8. What’s the time complexity of the .unshift array method?
    O(n), it moves all the elements

9. What’s the time complexity of the .push array method?
    O(1), it is a single add operation

10. What’s the time complexity of the .splice array method?
    O(n), it moves elements

11. What’s the time complexity of the .pop array method?
    O(1), it removes the last element and doesn't change anything else

12. What’s the time complexity of the Object.keys() function?
    O(n), it iterates over the elements
